### 👨‍💻 About Me

- I’m **Aben Samuel**, a **Head of Cloud & Infrastructure / Programme Delivery Director** helping organisations modernise on **Azure**.
- ~18+ years in tech, with 11+ years in the **ANZ** region delivering:
  - Large-scale **cloud migrations**
  - **Digital transformation** programmes
  - Cloud **governance, security, and cost optimisation**.
- I enjoy sitting at the intersection of:
  - **Architecture** (making the right technical bets)
  - **Delivery** (getting things shipped)
  - **Leadership** (growing teams and capability).

I use GitHub both for **serious cloud tooling** and **weekend experiments**—from Azure IaC to productivity apps and Linux setup scripts.

---

### 🚀 What I’m Currently Working On

- **Azure Cloud Manager / azmgr.ai**  
  A platform to:
  - Visualise and manage **Azure resources** at scale  
  - Drive **cost optimisation, tagging hygiene, and security compliance**  
  - Plug into **LLMs** so teams can ask questions about their cloud estate in natural language.

- **Trackly.nz – Office Attendance Tracker**  
  A **dual web app** (admin + attendance) to:
  - Track office presence & hybrid-working patterns  
  - Provide **exec-ready dashboards** for leaders  
  - Run on **Azure Static Web Apps + Supabase + GitHub Actions**.

- **Productivity & Dev Environment Tooling**
  - **Pomodoro timer + task manager** tuned to how I actually work.
  - **Windows & Linux bootstrap scripts** to bring any fresh machine to my ideal dev setup in one go (VS Code, WSL/Arch, tools, dotfiles, etc.).

### 🧰 Tech & Tools I Enjoy

**Cloud & Platform**
- ☁️ Azure (App Service, Container Apps, ACR, AKS, Front Door, VNets, Bicep)
- 🔐 Identity, security & governance (Entra ID, policies, landing zones)
- 💸 Cost optimisation, tagging strategies, FinOps-minded design

**Dev & DevOps**
- 🧪 GitHub Actions (multi-env pipelines, OIDC to Azure, CI/CD)
- 🧱 Bicep & ARM, a bit of Terraform
- 🐳 Docker, container-first workflows

**Backend & Frontend**
- ⚙️ TypeScript / JavaScript
- ⚛️ React, Azure Static Web Apps
- 🗄️ Supabase, Postgres, SQL Server (especially in HA/DR scenarios)

**AI & Automation**
- 🤖 Azure OpenAI & AI Studio / Foundry-style workflows
- 🧠 LLM-assisted tooling around cloud management and reporting

### 🗣️ Talks, Writing & Community

- ✍️ I write at **[Wellytonian.com](https://wellytonian.com)** about:
  - Cloud migration war stories
  - Azure architecture patterns
  - AI in real-world enterprises
  - “Don’t do this” lessons from the field
- 🎤 I speak about:
  - **Azure + AI + GitHub Copilot** in engineering teams
  - **Cloud foundations done right** (networking, identity, security, DR)
  - Modern **DevOps & platform engineering** practices.
- 👨‍🏫 I enjoy mentoring students and early-career engineers, especially around practical cloud skills and career arcs.

---

### 🧪 How I Like to Work

- **Data & outcomes first** – dashboards, cost views, uptime, and customer impact.
- **IaC or it didn’t happen** – infra and pipelines as code, versioned and repeatable.
- **Secure by default** – identities, network boundaries, secrets, and guardrails built-in.
- **Hands-on leadership** – I love whiteboards, but I also love a good `git diff`.
